### 🎯 **How to Explain in Interviews:**

> "In this benchmark project, I was responsible for the complete data analysis pipeline. I identified that we needed to process 316 measurements from raw logs to enable data-driven decisions. I designed the analysis framework and specified what metrics we needed to extract. For the technical implementation, I used AI-assisted development to accelerate the log parsing automation, but I was responsible for validating data accuracy, creating the executive visualizations, and translating the technical metrics into our production deployment decision. This approach allowed me to focus on higher-level problem-solving while maintaining technical ownership."
